**Questions**

Today I would like to answer a few questions while exploring my data. For this, I decided to have the eyes of someone who is interested in moving to New York but is part of a vulnerable sector in the US. As a result, I want to know how safe my new home will be. The three main questions I ask are:

* What areas are the safest?
* What segment of the population of New York City is most vulnerable to gun violence?
* What time of day and year are most likely correlated with increased gun violence?

My goal is that these questions will give a comprehensive view of where my model person, a black, 26-year-old woman, will be safe if they were to move to New York City.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I was able to begin answering the three questions I had set:

**What areas are the safest?**
I found that the area with the lowest number of cases was Staten Island, but the number of statistical murder cases versus the overall distribution of cases in Staten Island was the largest of all. Conversely, the area with the highest number of cases, Brooklyn, had a much lower distribution of statistical murder cases in comparison to its over number of cases. All of the areas seem to have a statistical murder count of about 1/3 of their total number of cases, which means the best for my model to choose is an area with the lowest total number of cases, Staten Island, followed by Manhattan, then Queens.

**What segment of the population of New York City is most vulnerable to gun violence?**
From the analysis, it looks like the segment of the population most vulnerable to gun violence is black men within the 18 to 44 age range. Considering my model is a 26-year-old black woman, having two out of three characteristics with a high statistical chance of being hurt by gun violence does help give the model some perspective on what to choose. 

**What time of day and year are most likely correlated with increased levels of gun violence?**
I looked at the hour of the day, day of the week, and month of the year where the gun violence took place, and it turns out that a person is more likely to experience gun violence between 9 pm and 1 am, on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) and during the mid-year(June and July). On the other hand, the best time for our model to explore her new city is between 6 am to 12 pm, mid-week (Wednesdays) in February (mid-winter).
This analysis taught me a lot about human behavior and how it can affect how likely crime is or wouldn't normally occur. 

**What would I suggest to my model?**
Currently, I think this analysis _begins_ to answer questions, but with more data and background knowledge, I'm certain I will be able to give a more comprehensive idea of the best choice for my model on where she should decide to live. 

**Next steps?**
I would love to work on this data set in the future, possibly answering some of the additional questions I asked earlier in the report.
